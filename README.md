# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview
For this project, we are scraping web data for a website we're making about Mars. We are using various tools including:

* Python and Jupyter Notebook
* Chrome Developer Tools to identify HTML components
* Splinter to automate a web browser
* Beautiful Soup to extract the data needed for analysis
* MongoDB to store the data
* Flask to execute the scraping code, update the page with newest data, and display

## Results 
This project went well, as we were able to successfully create the website. In the process, I gained more familiarity with HTML elements, and used BeautifulSoup and Splinter to automate a web browser and perform a web scrape. I also created a Mongo database to store the data from the web scrape. Then I created a web application with Flask to display the data from the web scrape. Finally, I used Bootstrap components to polish the website and make it mobile-responsive.

Here's a screenshot of the top of the webpage, including a header with a background, the latest Mars news, an image of Mars, and a table of information about Mars.

For the module challenge, I added these photos of the four hemispheres of Mars.
